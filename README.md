# SRAM
Verilog code for designing SRAM

**Introduction**

SRAM (static RAM) is a type of random access memory (RAM) that stores data bits as long as power is applied. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), which must be refreshed on a regular basis, SRAM does not require this, resulting in improved performance and lower power consumption. However, SRAM is more expensive than DRAM and takes up much more space.
